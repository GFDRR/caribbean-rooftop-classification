## üìú Description
This work leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and data fusion techniques for the automated classification of rooftop  characteristics from very high-resolution orthophotos and airborne LiDAR data. 

The Digital Earth for a Resilient Caribbean project is intended to help governments produce more timely building information to improve resilience and disaster response in the Caribbean.
